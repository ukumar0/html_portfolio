    <ul><h3>Project list</h3>
        <li><a href="">Stock Prediction</a></li>
        <p>The stock prediction model was crafted using a concise tech stack, featuring Pandas and yfinance for data collection, NumPy and Scikit-Learn for preprocessing, and Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for model training. Evaluation metrics were computed with Scikit-Learn, and visualizations were generated using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Deployment considerations included Flask, Django, Heroku, and AWS Lambda. Data storage options comprised SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, while version control was maintained using Git. This precise tech stack ensures a focused and efficient approach to stock prediction.</p>
        <li><a href="">Fake Image Detection</a></li>
        <p>Detecting fake images involves using advanced techniques like neural networks, including CNNs and GANs, to spot signs of manipulation. Tools like FaceForensics++ and datasets like DeepFake Detection Challenge assist in model development. Services such as Microsoft Azure Face API and Adobe Content Authenticity Initiative contribute to the ongoing fight against deceptive visual content, ensuring the authenticity of images and videos.</p>
